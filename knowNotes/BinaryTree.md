# Binary Tree
a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Full Binary Tree
A full binary tree (sometimes referred to as a proper or plane binary tree) is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.

## Complete Binary Tree
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. A complete binary tree can be efficiently represented using an array.

## Degenerate Binary Tree
A degenerate (or pathological) tree is where each parent node has only one associated child node.[24] This means that the tree will behave like a linked list data structure.

## Perfect Binary Tree
A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.

## Balanced Binary Tree
A balanced binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.
